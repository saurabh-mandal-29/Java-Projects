# Project 1 : Online Quiz Application

The Online Quiz Application is a console-based quiz system built in Java. Users can take a quiz by answering a series of questions and receive feedback on their performance. This project focuses on reinforcing fundamental Java concepts, implementing user input handling, using data structures, applying conditional statements, and gaining experience in planning, coding, and testing.
> Project Objectives
- Learn Java Basics: Reinforce understanding of core Java concepts, including variables, loops, and arrays.
- Interactive Programming: Implement user input handling to create an engaging quiz-taking experience.
- Data Structures: Utilize data structures like lists to organize and manage quiz questions efficiently.
- Conditional Statements: Apply conditional statements to evaluate user responses and provide feedback.
- Project Workflow: Gain experience in planning, coding, and testing a small-scale project.

# Project 2 : Link Shortener Application

The main goal of this project is to create a simple Link Shortener application using Java. A Link
Shortener is a tool that takes a long URL and generates a short, unique identifier, allowing users to
share concise links. This project will give you insights into data structures, algorithms, and basic
web application development.
> Project Objectives
- Implement a Link Shortener system in Java.
- Develop functions to shorten long URLs and expand short URLs to their original form.
- Ensure the uniqueness of short URLs and handle potential collisions.
- Explore basic error handling and user feedback.
- Gain practical experience in Java programming, data structures, and algorithmic thinking.
