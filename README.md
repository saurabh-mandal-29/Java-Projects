# Project 1 : Online Quiz Application

The Online Quiz Application is a console-based quiz system built in Java. Users can take a quiz by answering a series of questions and receive feedback on their performance. This project focuses on reinforcing fundamental Java concepts, implementing user input handling, using data structures, applying conditional statements, and gaining experience in planning, coding, and testing.
> Project Objectives
- Learn Java Basics: Reinforce understanding of core Java concepts, including variables, loops, and arrays.
- Interactive Programming: Implement user input handling to create an engaging quiz-taking experience.
- Data Structures: Utilize data structures like lists to organize and manage quiz questions efficiently.
- Conditional Statements: Apply conditional statements to evaluate user responses and provide feedback.
- Project Workflow: Gain experience in planning, coding, and testing a small-scale project.

# Project 2 : Link Shortener Application

The main goal of this project is to create a simple Link Shortener application using Java. A Link
Shortener is a tool that takes a long URL and generates a short, unique identifier, allowing users to
share concise links. This project will give you insights into data structures, algorithms, and basic
web application development.
> Project Objectives
- Implement a Link Shortener system in Java.
- Develop functions to shorten long URLs and expand short URLs to their original form.
- Ensure the uniqueness of short URLs and handle potential collisions.
- Explore basic error handling and user feedback.
- Gain practical experience in Java programming, data structures, and algorithmic thinking.

# Project 3 : Expense Tracker Application

The Expense Tracker project aims to create a robust and user-friendly application that allows users
to manage and monitor their expenses efficiently. This program will serve as a hands-on
experience in applying Java programming concepts to develop a functional and practical software
solution.
> Project Objectives
- Understanding Java Fundamentals: Strengthen your grasp on core Java concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and exception handling.
- Data Handling: Implement data structures and algorithms to manage and organize expense data effectively.
- User Interface Design: Develop a simple and intuitive user interface for users to input, edit, and view their expenses.
- File Handling: Utilize file I/O operations to save and load expense data, ensuring persistence across sessions.
- Exception Handling: Implement robust error handling to enhance the reliability of the application.
